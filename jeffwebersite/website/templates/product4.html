    <div class="product_infy">BOTH PUMP POWER AND VAPORIZER HEAT ARE SUPPLIED BY A COGENERATIVE DIESEL POWER PACK, WHICH CONVERTS WASTE ENGINE HEAT GENERATED BY THE ENGINE AND HYDRAULICS INTO USEFUL HEAT FOR NITROGEN VAPORIZATION. TO BALANCE THE HEAT LOAD ON THE COOLING SYSTEM, WASTE SYSTEM HEAT AND THAT GENERATED BY THE HYDRAULICS IS TRANSFERRED TO THE COOLING SYSTEM. PROVIDING SUFFICIENT HEAT FOR NITROGEN VAPORIZATION, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURING THAT HEAT INFLUX TO THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM AND DIESEL ENGINE (DUE TO NORMAL MECHANICAL INEFFICIENCIES) IS PROPERLY DISSIPATED.

DURING NORMAL OPERATION, LIQUID FLOWS FROM THE 4000 GALLON STORAGE TANK SUPPLY VALVE, INTO THE LN2 CENTRIFUGAL CHARGE PUMP WHERE LN2 PRESSURE IS BOOSTED BEFORE FLOWING INTO THE HIGH PRESSURE PUMP WHERE IT IS PRESSURIZED BY RECIPROCATING PISTONS TO DOWNSTREAM PRESSURE. THE HIGH PRESSURE LIQUID THEN FLOWS INTO VAPORIZER, ABSORBS A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF HEAT TO RAISE ITS TEMPERATURE TO 60 F – 70 F AT FLOW RATES UP TO 270,000 SCFH AND FLOWS OUT THROUGH DISCHARGE CONNECTION AS A HIGH PRESSURE GAS.</div>
